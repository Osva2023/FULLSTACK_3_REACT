React and React Native are both frameworks developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, but they serve different purposes and target different platforms:

React (React.js or React Web):

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for web applications. It is used for creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces on web pages. React is designed to build applications that run in web browsers.

React Native:

React Native is a framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to use React to build applications for iOS and Android platforms. React Native is specifically designed for mobile app development, allowing you to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android platforms.

While the core concepts of components remain the same, React components for the web may differ from React Native components due to the nature of the target platforms. Different Styling, APIS and FEATURES, and, of course, the Deployment

React is often referred to as a library rather than a framework. The main difference between a library and a framework lies in the control flow.

Library: A library is a collection of functions and routines which can be reused for developing applications. The developer calls the functions when needed.

Framework: A framework, on the other hand, is a set of tools, conventions, and guidelines that dictate how software should be structured. In a framework, the overall program flow is controlled by the framework, and the developer fills in the details.

In simple terms, HTML is the standard language for building web pages, while JSX is a special syntax used in React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. JSX looks a lot like HTML, but it's written within JavaScript code. It helps developers create interactive and dynamic user interfaces in a more convenient way when working with React.

In our case, we are going to work on REACT, because React uses a component-based architecture, allowing you to break down the UI into independent, reusable components. This makes it easier to manage and maintain code, especially for large and complex applications. React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance. It updates only the parts of the actual DOM that are changed, leading to faster rendering and a smoother user experience. React follows a unidirectional data flow, making it predictable and easier to debug. Data changes flow in a single direction, preventing unexpected side effects. These are the main benefits of using React in our project.

In our project, we choose to use a MERN STACK
Other alternatives include MVC, which is Model-View-Controller, and it's a software architectural pattern commonly used in web development. MEAN, which is similar but using MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.
MEVN, which is similar but using MongoDB, Express, Vue, and Node.
LAMP, which is similar but using Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
Django, which is similar but using Python, Django, and SQLite.

The MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) is a popular choice for full-stack web development for several reasons:
MERN uses JavaScript for both the frontend and backend, which simplifies development by allowing developers to use the same language across the entire stack.
With JavaScript being used on both ends, there's a higher degree of code reusability. For example, components developed for the frontend using React can be reused on the backend with Node.js.
React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is excellent for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components, making the development process more efficient.
MongoDB, a NoSQL database, provides flexibility in handling data with a dynamic schema. It can accommodate changes in data structure over time, making it well-suited for agile development.
JSON is used for data interchange between the frontend and the backend. Since MongoDB stores data in BSON format (binary JSON), there's a natural synergy in data representation.
All components of the MERN stack are open source, contributing to their popularity. This openness facilitates collaboration, innovation, and continuous improvement within the development community.
