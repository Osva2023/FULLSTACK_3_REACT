Components are the basic building blocks of a user interface. Components are reusable building units that allow organizing and dividing the user interface into smaller, manageable parts. They are, like, writen HTML and Javascriotin the same file, at the same time, visual elements, and the behavior of the elements. But also, is taking the pieces that we need in every part of the interface and put them together in a single file.

Props, or properties, ar the values that we give to our components. They are the values that we pass to our components. They are, like, HTML attributes, and the behavior of the elements.

State is a special object that represents the internal and mutable part of a component. The state allows React components to store and handle data that may change over time. When the state of a component changes, React takes care of automatically updating the user interface to reflect those changes.
